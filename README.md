# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
This is a simple and fun game inspired by the "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" version made popular by The Big Bang Theory. I built this project while learning Pygame, and created all visual assets by hand using IbisPaint X.

Features:
🖐 Five hand signs: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
🎨 All game art (hand signs, buttons, backgrounds) drawn by me
🧠 Game logic for win/lose/draw outcomes
🖱 Click-based interaction with clean feedback
🔁 Replay or Exit after each round

Technologies Used:
Python 3
Pygame
IbisPaint X (for drawing assets)

How to Run:
Install Python 3

Install Pygame:
pip install pygame

Run the game:
python main.py

What I Learned:
1. Setting up a Pygame window and event loop
2. Handling mouse input and button interactions
3. Displaying and scaling images in Pygame
4. Structuring a simple game from scratch
5. Combining code and pixel art to build an interactive project
